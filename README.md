# Personal Portfolio

This is my first personal portfolio project built while learning **HTML** and **CSS** (with a touch of **Bootstrap 5**).  
It is a simple and clean website that includes sections like **Home**, **About**, **Gallery**, and **Contact**.  

### Features
- Responsive design using Bootstrap  
- Simple navigation bar  
- About section with a short intro  
- Gallery with images  
- Contact form  
- Footer with copyright

### Purpose
This project was made just to practice and understand the basics of web design — how layouts, images, and text work together on a webpage.

### Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Bootstrap 5  

### Note
I created this while practicing basic layout, navigation, and design.
I am still learning web development, so this project might not be perfect, but it’s a step forward in my learning journey.  
If you notice something off or think it can be improved, I’m open to learning from your feedback.
