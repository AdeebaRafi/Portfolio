        <h1>Adeeba Rafi</h1>
       <p class="intro">
  I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hazara University, Mansehra, Pakistan (September 2024).<br />
  My interests are in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, and <strong>Robotics</strong>.<br />
  I am passionate about research and want to contribute to these fields in the future.<br />
  I like joining hackathons every month because they help me learn new things while working in a team. Each project teaches a new lesson, whether it is about the idea, the logic, or the implementation.<br />
  I also enjoy problem-solving competitions. They help me improve by working with different people who offer different ways to think about a problem.<br />
  I believe in <strong>consistency</strong>. I try to become a better person every day and learn something new daily to improve at least <strong>1% each day</strong>.<br />
